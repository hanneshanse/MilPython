'''
This is a basic example for the milpython-framework.
This example contains a small buliding-energy-system.
It consits of a building with a battery and a constant electrical load.
The electricity price oscillates.
The total electricity cost is getting optimized

This version of example 01: "basic_LP_example" uses the local version of the MilPython-Framework found at src/MilPython
Using a local version of the framework instead of using the package via "pip install milpython" can be usefull if a customization of the framework is necessary

! The code in src may not be up to date with the latest version of the package !
