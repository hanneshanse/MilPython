'''
This is a basic example for the milpython-framework.
This example contains a small buliding-energy-system.
It consits of a building with a battery and a constant electrical load.
The electricity price oscillates.
The total electricity cost is getting optimized

This example shows simplifitations and possible short forms of the syntax for the fuctions add_var_targetfun and add_eq.
